            <p>
                My name is Olatunji Nurudeen, the name of my favourite artist is Abiola<br>Ahmed Akinbiyi (born 27
                January
                1996), known professionally as Bella<br>Shmurda, is a Nigerian singer and songwriter. He rose
                to prominence in<br>2019 with the release of the song "Vision 2020", and a follow-up remix<br>which
                featured
                Olamide. He is also the leader of Dangbana Republik;<br>a collective of creatives in Lagos providing
                community and humanita-<br>rian contributions. Bella Shmurda hails from a polygamous family
                in<br>Ikorodu
                and is
                the last child from a family of 10 children. His journey<br>in arts began in his early days through

                song.

                it
                viral and earned the interest<br>of Olamide who invited the latter over to his studio for a
                remix.<br>The
